  <h3>WRONG RISK TO AVOID WHILE IN RELATIONSHIP OR AT THE VERGE OF PROPOSAL </h3>

 <h5>Personal Advise on Love </h5>

          <span style="color: red;">NEVER HIDE YOUR RELATIONSHIP LIFE FROM YOUR LEADERS/MENTOR/PASTOR. </span>

          The devil will never win you, it's  only based on your ignorance. The Bible says: with multitude of counselors there is safety.

          <span><i style="color: red;"> Proverbs 11:14 </i></span>   Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety. <br>

          These period where guys sleeps with ladies, use them for rituals and kill them is because these ladies hide all their moves from their leaders.

          When a lady does not have someone who can give her advise or keeps secret far from them; then, there is a big problem she will face at the end that no one can save her.

          The devils love it when you hide things from those who should advise you or those who have knowledge better than you or can be of help to you. <br><br>

          A pastor in Port Harcourt said that a man entered his church of which he knows many things about the man because he came for counseling. 
          This man met a sister who happens to be her daughter in the Lord. she never told him as her pastor. So, a day came when he was aware, he warned the man and called the daughter and asked "why did you hide this from me"?.

          Then he asked her I hope you never slept with him, she said she has, the pastor said that man is HIV positive. Then, he told her that she ruined her life by herself. <br>

          Most ladies think that their leaders are fools. Not knowing that leaders knows secrete about everyone you don't know in the fellowship.

          Some persons in the fellowship once had children and are having great foundational problems.
          The moment the young man said, don't let the leader knows we are dating. You're a fool to agree.
